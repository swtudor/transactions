# Transactions Application and Labs
This mini application is developed as the seed code for an interactive 3-day course taking students through the fundamentals
of Java with an introduction to Spring Boot and unit testing in Spring with Mockito & JUnit. 

Below are several Pluralasight courses (and a handful of free courses/tutorials) that can be used in addition to or instead of the instructor-led course. 
If you are already familiar with the basics of Java & Spring Boot, just jump in and use the [labs](LABS.md) as a way to guide you through a project.

Start with the main branch and work through the labs in order. If you get stuck, you can checkout the corresponding branch to see my solution.
You will learn better if you try and push through the stuck at least a little while before peeking at the solution code.
